# Which type of software development process is applied.<br />
#### Agile process.<br />

# Why you choses this type (Waterfall vs. Agile)?<br />
* We sincerely welcome changes in requirments,even in the later stages of development.<br />
* Agile processes control changes to maintain the customer's competitive advantage.<br />
* Deliver usable software frequently,the frequency can range from weeks to months,preferably at intervals per second.<br />
---------------------------------------
# Possible usage of your software (i.e., target market)<br />
#### Our market goal is to focus on the main force to attract palyer's attention,pass a certain amount of time, and the method of downloading or playing games is very simple.<br />

# Development Process<br />
* Step 1: Analyze the most popular game type (casual game) during the epidemic.
* Step 2: Refer to different websites to get the little game of rock-scissors-cloth.
* Step 3: write code with reference to different web pages.
* Step 4: Run the code and debug.
