# Why you choses this type (Waterfall vs. Agile)?<br />
* We sincerely welcome changes in requirments,even in the later stages of development.<br />
* Agile processes control changes to maintain the customer's competitive advantage.<br />
* Deliver usable software frequently,the frequency can range from weeks to months,preferably at intervals per second.<br />
